# Rotate All Bodies in Active Part Along X-Axis in SolidWorks

## Description
This macro rotates all bodies in the active part document along the X-axis by a specified angle (in degrees), in either a positive or negative direction. Itâ€™s ideal for adjusting the orientation of all bodies within a part file for alignment or repositioning needs.

## System Requirements
- **SolidWorks Version**: SolidWorks 2014 or newer
- **Operating System**: Windows 7 or later

## Pre-Conditions
> [!NOTE]
> - The active document must be a part document containing at least one body.
> - The macro prompts the user to enter an angle (in degrees) for the rotation.

## Results
> [!NOTE]
> - All bodies in the part are rotated along the X-axis by the specified angle.
> - The macro clears selections and sets the rotation transformation based on the entered angle.
