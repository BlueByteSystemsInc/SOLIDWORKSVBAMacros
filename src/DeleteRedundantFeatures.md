<img src="../images/DeleteRedundantFeatures.png" alt="Description of image" width="600" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">

## Description
This macro identifies and allows users to delete features with no children (redundant features) in a SolidWorks model. The macro supports features like planes, coordinate systems, axes, sketches, and more.

## System Requirements
- **SolidWorks Version**: SolidWorks 2014 or newer  
- **Operating System**: Windows 7 or later  

## Pre-Conditions
> [!NOTE]
> - A part document must be open in SolidWorks.  
> - The macro works only on features that have no dependencies.

## Results
> [!NOTE]
> - A user interface lists redundant features.  
> - Users can select features to delete directly from the interface.

## Steps to Setup the Macro

### 1. **Create the Form in the VBA Editor**:
- Open the VBA editor in SolidWorks by pressing (`Alt + F11`).
- In the VBA editor, go to **Insert > UserForm** to create a new form.
- Add the following elements to the form:
  - **ListBox**:
    - Name: `ListBox1`
    - Positioned to display feature names.
  - **Command Buttons**:
    - **Delete Button**:
      - Name: `CommandButton1`
      - Caption: `Delete`
    - **Cancel Button**:
      - Name: `CommandButton2`
      - Caption: `Cancel`
- Adjust the formâ€™s caption to **Delete features with no children**.
- Save the macro project.

### 2: **Run the Macro**
- Open a part document in SolidWorks.
- Run the macro.
- The form will display all redundant features. Select the features you want to delete and click **Delete**.
